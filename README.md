# cForge

cForge is a lightweight library designed to help you build scalable and efficient C applications. It is similar to Rust's cargo, providing a set of tools for managing your C projects.

One common challenge when starting a new C project is the tedious process of creating a project structure, organizing files, and configuring project settings such as CMakeLists.txt. Additionally, it's easy to forget to initialize a new project with git, which can cause headaches down the line.

## Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anthhon/cForge.git
or
git clone git@github.com:Anthhon/cForge.git
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. && make
```
